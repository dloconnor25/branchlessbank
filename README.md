    - Speed
    - Customer support

- BACKGROUND INFORMATION/ HISTORY:

    - Founded in 2015, after founder, Andrew Melo, spent more time traveling than at home, and it became problematic that he was struggling to do his banking needs. He came up with a completely online-only bank, now he needs our help to create this.

- SWOT ANALYSIS:

    - STRENGTHS:

        - online accessibility, always have access when you have data/internet anywhere
        - user friendly because it was designed solely for app/website usage
        - simple actions, basic banking
        - green, paper saving, money saving due to no physical locations
        - can access money at ANY ATM
        - photo check deposits

    - WEAKNESSES:

        - online only, could be problematic in areas where there isn’t developed internet/data coverage

            - internet/data issue when traveling outside country
        - no physical location, means you must have a device to access money/assistance
        - withdrawal of physical money issues
        - likely higher ATM fees
        - international security/ identity protection
        - opening accounts
        - initial bank transition from old bank to branchless (security, potential identity validation issues)

    - OPPORTUNITIES:

        - combine social money transfers like venom app, basically can text friends money across any banking system
        - green movement
        - travel ease
        - no hoops to jump through when traveling around
        - company accounts for traveling employees
        - independent working individuals (like musicians or artists) can set up proper accounts to do business anywhere
        - creating accounts without having to go into a bank (make it easy, simple, secure)

    - THREATS:

        - Other apps like Venom make money transfers easy and fun, popular within target audience
        - other physical banks are shifting focus towards mobile banking and have apps to support it
        - can go to physical location if problem arises where the internet is not an option

- FEATURES INCLUDED:

    - Include social money sharing like Venom app, to make money transfers easy and fun, popular within target audience. More simple than Paypal
    - Liked up online pay app when checking out for online shopping (like apple pay). Or we can link the app to apple pay to integrate more established user base.
    - Bill pay

        - can pay companies, individuals, recurring or one time.
        - Promised transfers/deposits to be completed in under 12 hours or less (time cushion added in for international transfers)
    - Photo deposits of checks

        - Linked feature for you employer to pay you directly into account
    - Finger print scan login, for seamless fast access that is secure

        - back up login with user name and password
    - Cash withdrawal available thru common ATMS, try to cut back fees as much as possible especially for international locations
    - Debit/Credit cards available

        - CAN order checkbooks, but it is not a main focus since we are green
    - Customer support

        - 24/7 support available via phone and in-app live chat with real person.

            - Email recap of assistance topic, conversation, conclusion, and follow up satisfaction.

CREATIVE BRIEF
Client Background

- Branchless Bank is an online only banking service heavily focused on customers using mobile devices. The company and app is hopping on the “green” train and going paperless with no brick and mortar locations. Their vision is to achieve a seamless, simple, and always accessible app that has the capabilities to handle all banking needs anywhere in the world. Branchless wants the service to be efficient, quick, and “hassle free” banking that will make customers want to leave behind their classic banking company. In order to achieve customers to want to ditch their classic banking style we will have to overcome perceptions of lesser security, increased threat to identity theft, and the idea that customer support/access would be lesser.

Project overview

- This project is about simple, seamless, online banking needs. It should be clean, yet have all the options they customer might need without appearing visually overwhelming. There should be a design that supports immediate usability with little to know learning curve. The design will incorporate modern technological features like touch ID fingerprint recognition, photo capabilities, and easy social money sharing. Right now there are so many different banking, money transferring, and management apps but there is no app that can do it all. That is the goal.
- What is the project all about? What is the design for and why is it needed? What opportunities will the project present?
This will give you a general idea of what to work on and how to attack it. After all, understanding why the project is needed is just as important as finding out what the project is, because this would allow you to take the most fitting format depending on the situation.

Target Audience
     General Age Range: 25-35 yrs old

-      Students
    - Away from home, out of state or out of town
    - still slightly dependent on parents, but have their own accounts
    - study abroad
- Young professionals
    - sales, consultants, creatives, independently employed, athletes, etc…

I chose this Target audience range assuming that customers outside of the 25-35 year range would be active users, however for marketing purposes I consider this to be the most involved audience due to their financial independence and flexible lifestyles. I project that the broader age range will be 20-45 due to young adults becoming more active banking users and the fact that adults are waiting longer to start families because they are more career driven, leading me to think they will be working/traveling until later ages before settling down for a more stationary lifestyle. Our audience is constantly on the move, traveling in-state, out of state, and internationally for business or education purposes. This age group, predominantly millennials, have a strong passion for travel and spending money on experiences rather than possessions, there for the flexibility and simplicity of travel capable features will be a huge draw.
