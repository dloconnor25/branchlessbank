RESEARCH & BRAINSTORMING

    - Secure/ protected
    - Speed
    - Customer support

- BACKGROUND INFORMATION/ HISTORY:

    - Founded in 2015, after founder, Andrew Melo, spent more time traveling than at home, and it became problematic that he was struggling to do his banking needs. He came up with a completely online-only bank, now he needs our help to create this.

- SWOT ANALYSIS:

    - STRENGTHS:

        - online accessibility, always have access when you have data/internet anywhere
        - user friendly because it was designed solely for app/website usage
        - simple actions, basic banking
        - green, paper saving, money saving due to no physical locations
        - can access money at ANY ATM
        - photo check deposits

    - WEAKNESSES:

        - online only, could be problematic in areas where there isnâ€™t developed internet/data coverage

            - internet/data issue when traveling outside country
        - no physical location, means you must have a device to access money/assistance
        - withdrawal of physical money issues
        - likely higher ATM fees
        - international security/ identity protection
        - opening accounts
        - initial bank transition from old bank to branchless (security, potential identity validation issues)

    - OPPORTUNITIES:

        - combine social money transfers like venom app, basically can text friends money across any banking system
        - green movement
        - travel ease
        - no hoops to jump through when traveling around
        - company accounts for traveling employees
        - independent working individuals (like musicians or artists) can set up proper accounts to do business anywhere
        - creating accounts without having to go into a bank (make it easy, simple, secure)

    - THREATS:

        - Other apps like Venom make money transfers easy and fun, popular within target audience
        - other physical banks are shifting focus towards mobile banking and have apps to support it
        - can go to physical location if problem arises where the internet is not an option

- FEATURES INCLUDED:

    - Include social money sharing like Venom app, to make money transfers easy and fun, popular within target audience. More simple than Paypal
    - Liked up online pay app when checking out for online shopping (like apple pay). Or we can link the app to apple pay to integrate more established user base.
    - Bill pay

        - can pay companies, individuals, recurring or one time.
        - Promised transfers/deposits to be completed in under 12 hours or less (time cushion added in for international transfers)
    - Photo deposits of checks

        - Linked feature for you employer to pay you directly into account
    - Finger print scan login, for seamless fast access that is secure
